  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Amadou Tidiane Kane. I'm from Senegal and I love IT.</p>
  <p>I have got a bachelor in computer science and I'd like to improve my skills. I have been working in management for 8 years now but I'm more interested in computer science.</p>
